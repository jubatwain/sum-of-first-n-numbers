# sum-of-first-n-numbers
The Python code provided calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers. 
It first prompts the user to input the value of n. 
Then it calls the sum function, which takes the input value of n as its argument and uses a loop to calculate the sum of the first n numbers. 
Finally, the code prints out the result of the calculation.
In essence, the code implements a simple algorithm that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers and provides a way for users to input the value of n and view the result of the calculation.
